Modules
-------
**Notes:**
* Any commands prefixed with `sm_` may also be used in chat via `/` or `!` - for example, `/ready` or `!ready` in chat is equivalent to `sm_ready` in the console.

### Coaches
*adds abilities for players to act as coaches*

#### Console Commands
`sm_becomecoach`, if used while a player is on a team, places them in a coach role where they are only able to spectate other teammates. `sm_becomeplayer` removes the coach status and allows the player to play normally.

### Game Countdowns
*manages start countdowns for competitive games*

#### Console Variables
`compctrl_gamecountdowns_managed` determines whether the countdowns are managed - if not, game countdowns are run normally by the game. `compctrl_gamecountdowns_time` determines how long the countdowns will run, overriding the game's default countdown length of 5 or 10 seconds. `compctrl_gamecountdowns_paused` determines if the current countdown (if any) is paused - if a countdown is running and is paused, the countdown will be reset to full length. `compctrl_gamecountdowns_autorun` determines if the countdowns should automatically run when triggered by the game, though their length will still be customized and can still be paused/unpaused via the other console variables.

### Map Timers
*manages the map timer*

#### Console Variables
`compctrl_maptimers_autopause` determines whether the map timer should pause when the game is not being actively played.

### Matches
*manages the flow of a match*

#### Admin Commands
`sm_startmatch <config>` is used to start a match with a specified config. The command requires the name of a match config file (without the `.cfg` extension) that will be used to regulate the match. `sm_cancelmatch` cancels any match that may be in progress.

#### Console Commands
`sm_matchstatus` will display the current status of the ongoing match.

#### Configuration Files
All of the files within the `configs/compctrl/matches` may be used by the `sm_startmatch` command. You may add, remove, or modify configs in this folder as desired (but if you do, make sure to back up your configs in case they are overwritten during a CompCtrl update).

### Player Aliases
*enforces player aliases*

#### Admin Commands
`sm_setalias <steamid> <alias>` will set the enforced alias for a user, while `sm_removealias <steamid>` will remove it.

### Strategy Periods
*adds time between rounds to strategize*

#### Console Commands
`sm_requestpause` will pause the timer if currently in a strategy period, and otherwise will schedule a pause for the next strategy period. `sm_cancelpause` will cancel any current pause in a strategy period and any future requests.

#### Console Variables
`compctrl_strategyperiods_time` determines how long each strategy period is (in seconds).
